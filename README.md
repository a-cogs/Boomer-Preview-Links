# Boomer-Preview-Links
This allows a popup preview link to display when hovering an anchor link.

It finds the anchors on the page that refer to other pages on the parent site, then gives them a treatment that displays a preview of the page content when the link is hovered. It is a decent example of the strengths of jQuery.

This is a test that runs after the DOM loads.
